##Pupila

Pupila's main objective is to provide to the user relevant visual information in real time.

Pupila aims to be a helpful resource to blind and non visually-challenged persons, solving unconfortable situations like  lost keys, enabling them to independently navigate through the city anf finding out what an object is without touching it.

Originally conceived to be implemented with Hololens, valid monetary concerns quickly redirected us to aim for a smartphone implementation to test the main idea, make use of the available technology and explore available possibilities.

It uses 
 * Visual Recognition (IBM Watson Developer Cloud)
 * Smartphone Camaras
 * Text-to-voice & voice-to-text 
 * Geolicalization
 * Server uses Java module/nodeJS
 * Cordova/Ionic

Finally, Beware! The main developer's main communication language is heavily accented Spanish, so you might find some oddly named variables.
